2002-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/shar.c (generate_configure): Do not use "head -1" or
	"test ... -a ..."; they are not standardized by basic POSIX
	1003.1-2001 and have portability problems in practice.

        bin_PROGRAMS.

	* Makefile.am: Initial revision.

Sat Mar 16 12:23:35 1996  Karl Eichwalder  <ke@ke.Central.DE>

	* mailshar.in: Add `-S SUBJECT' to override the subject line.

Thu Mar 14 10:54:44 1996  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontral.ca>

	* remsync.in: Improved internal documentation:

	* Documented all global variables, hopefully.

	* Systematically turned "..." strings into '...' in all
	cases interpolation is not needed, as a kind of
	auto-commenting.

	* Renamed many variables and strings, because archives are
	now invoices, package file is now the order file,
	registering is learning (or knowing), and unregistering is
	forgetting.

	* Renamed %here_signature to %local_signature.

	* Systematically rewrote @array[$index] into $array[$index].

	Improved inner workings:

	* Simplified --version and --help decoding.

	* Added a few missing local declarations.

	* Removed hacks for reading .remsync formats prior to 1.3:
	format was once remsync or version, here was once local,
	and ignore regexps were once unanchored.

	Improved usability:

	* Automatically accept the registration of files of no
	more than 100K in size.  Ask confirmation only for bigger
	files, once at the end.  Also, list size of newly
	discovered files.

	* List all local files which are subject to deletion,
	prior to interacting with the user about them.  Accept `a'
	for deleting all remaining deletable files and `q' to quit
	the deleting loop.  This is much better than interacting
	on each file and not letting the user feel how many such
	deletions are scheduled.

	* When detecting sterile scans, explain the user it has to
	delete the scan or populate it, prior to offering to
	delete the scan, instead of after.

	* When diffing and later diagnosing, use two full filename
	paths, instead of one full and the other relative.  *
	Remove a possible .resync-work/orders~ file, in case the
	order file gets edited by hand.

	Corrected genuine bugs:

	* Properly uncapitalize remote addresses on receipt.

	* Interactively reconciliate directory discrepancies on
	receipt, instead of wrongly deleting the remote
	description.

	* Rename $from_email to $originator, and properly
	initialize the variable.  This might solve a nasty bug by
	which partial broadcasts were not always processed
	correctly on receipt, causing further broadcasts to be
	sent to the wrong sites.

	* Kludge in a corrective behavior by which an ignore of
	\.remsync shall be turned into \.remsync.*, so backups of
	configuration or even whole synchronization invoices or
	directories will stop being themselves synchronized.

	* Avoid calling the sum program on no file, by using -r
	option to xargs, and simplify the find call knowing it is
	GNU's.  One was sometimes getting diagnostics about
	invalid sum output.

Fri Mar  1 20:24:30 1996  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@myware>

	* shar.c (generate_configure): Miss test for $shar_n and $shar_c
	only if quiet_unshar_mode.
	(generate_mkdir): Use xstrdup.
	Start of friendlier messages.

	* shar.c (generate_configure): Create code for making directory if
	file_size_limit != 0, not when split_file_mode != 0.  Later will
	not work for -l.  Reported by Bill Aten.

Fri Dec 29 21:09:01 1995  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@myware>

	* shar.c (set_file_mode): Selecting uuencode mode should not
	contradict compression.  Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

	* shar.c (CHARACTER_COUNT_COMMAND): Use a shorter string.  Simply
	LC_ALL=C must catch all cases.

Tue Dec 19 22:16:20 1995  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@myware>

	While detecting md5sum do not use -h option.  md5sum in
	textutils-1.13 does not have this option anymore.  Use --help instead.

	program still gives you the complate usage message and so it still

	file.  Reported by Karl Berry.

Tue Sep 26 00:29:26 1995  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@myware>

	Undid last change.  On some systems libintl.a is not

Thu Aug 17 23:54:36 1995  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@myware>

	Don't use `getpid' all the time.  This leads to problems with fork'ed
	processes.  Instead determine the number once at the beginning.
	(sharpid): New variable.

	* shar.c (shar):
	Add a ! character after $shar_count string in error message because
